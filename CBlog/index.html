                <p>Hi everybody, my name is Dylan and this is my blog page. I am a 25 year old man. An extroverted
                    thrill seeker who has a
                    passion for the outdoors and people. I will be blogging about my life, Friends and family in the
                    city of Johannesburg,
                    South Africa.</p>

                <h2>My Characters description and rationale</h2>
                &nbsp;
                <p>My character is a thrill and adventure seeker who is always looking to experience something new that
                    he hasn't seen before. Being highly extroverted he finds comfort in crowds and being with people
                    sharing his experiences. With being highly extroverted he is also quite hot headed and impatient at
                    times when he is frustrated or uneasy but he is also one of the most laid back and easy going people
                    when he is comfortable in his enviroment. Being based in the city of Cape Town, South Africa my
                    character Dylan loves to travel and explore different people and cultures. He also has a keen eye
                    for art and images when on adventures end exploring. He has quite a broad sense of humor anything
                    from well placed comments to funny pictures makes him laugh, with this sense of humor being so
                    prominant he often jokes around a lot and tires to make light of dim situations.
