        <h2>The web 2.0</h2>
        <p>Imagine a world with no social media, no youtube, no apps or online games. For the newer generations this
            seems like an impossible world to live in, the idea of not being connected is a scary thought, but for the
            older generations this was once a reality… even the thought of sending a message or image to someone halfway
            across the world in seconds was a crazy idea. I know for sure that I would never be able to survive in such
            a reality. Before the upgraded version of the web (known as the web 2.0) the internet was very bland, only
            reems of text could be searched and what would return would be text as well not nice to look at if you’re a
            person who has no clue what’s cooking. Then this all changed with the invention of the web 2.0. the web 2.0
            was focused on more user generated content and ease of use for the average everyday person, this means that
            you don’t need to be an expert to know how to use the web, simply click and go!! This opened up a whole
            world of opportunities and access to archives upon archives of information, you could now search images,
            videos, chat with friends on social media networking sites, the list goes on and on. However this was not an
            instant upgrade, the move from the web 1.0 to 2.0 took years to fully establish, slowly getting more users.
            Without making the internet widely accessible to the people of the world the advancement in technologies and
            the great advancement of knowledge that we’ve seen in the past few years would’ve never taken place.

        <h2>The Browser wars</h2>
        <p>How did the world wide web go from being unbelievably difficult to navigate to the most easily accessible
            source of information that the world has ever known?? This is all thanks to the browser. But how did the
            browser come about you ask?
            Well long ago a team of undergraduate students at the university of Illinois lead by Marc Andreessen had an
            idea, to make the world wide web easily accessible to everyone and so a software program called the browser
            was born, an interface that turned text only data into images, videos, hypertexts and many more ways of
            viewing data. This made surfing the internet a user-friendly experience for all to enjoy.
            So how did the browser start?
            While in university the team of students developed mosaic, the first user friendly browser, this was sadly
            owned by the university as they developed it at the university and they owned the intellectual rights to the
            information. So to avoid being taken to court the team had to start from the ground up in redeveloping the
            browser software, they made it better that the last and added new features. This was the rise of the first
            internet browser and netscape was born, a completely new browser with new features that made use of new
            techniques to secure the users data, these are the SSL Protocol and the TLS to add privacy and security.
            This was the beginning of the browser wars. Microsoft then bought Mosaic the program that the students had
            previously developed and developed a new browser, Internet Explorer. This browser competed with netscapes
            browser. This is the start of the war between them. Microsoft being the multi-billion dollar company that it
            is was basically a ‘super-power’ that Netscape could not compete with. Microsoft then won the war with
            internet explorer, netscape stayed alive for a partial time after that but eventually had to close down. But
            netscape had one final trick up their sleeve, before closing down Netscape publicaly released the source
            code for their browser hoping that this would give rise to new browser developers that could challenge
            microsofts internet explorer, and so it did and new browsers started to appear, Mozilla and Firefox being
            the most popular these are all build on netscapes original source code.

        <h2>What are URLs and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>A URL… sounds complicated right? I’m writing this to shed some light on the matter. In plain terms the URL or
            Uniform Resource Locator is one of the most important cogs that makes a web browser tick. It allows a
            browser to fetch any resources on the web . it is nothing more than a unique address to where information
            that you are looking for can be found. Its basically like asking for a friends home address so that you know
            where he keeps all his stuff.
            So how do they work ?
            Well I wont bore you with many technical terms but think of your browser as a GPS, you type in the address
            that you want to go to and it uses a path to go to directly to that address, fetches what you need and then
            brings it back to you, so that the stuff stored at your friends house is now available for you to use. But
            URLs have a lot more complexity behind them. They have many different aspects of the address that they
            specifically look at and that are critical to their functioning, they have protocols which tells the browser
            how to transport the data forward and back from the server, ports which tells the browser which gate to use
            and get into the website, paths to files which detail exactly where the file that you are searching for can
            be found. I think that these are the most important aspects of the URL however the URL cannot can not
            function without the Domain names, Parameters, and Anchors. Together all of these modules form the URL and
            how it functions. The URL is arguably one of the most important aspects of the internet and without it, the
            internet would not function.

        <h2>A reflection on a brief history of web robots</h2>
        <p>They go by many names, web robots, crawlers, spiders. What actually are they? Well they’re programs that
            search the internet for you to find many different types of information that can either be used for good
            intentions, to help us, or for bad intentions.
            Lets face it we’re all lazy, its what makes us human I would even go as far as saying its in our DNA. So why
            crawl the internet yourself which could take hours to find what you’re looking for when you can just get
            something else to do it for you, making your life so much easier. This is where web robots come in. they
            search the internet for you and return information that they’ve found regarding what you’ve searched. Almost
            all search engines use them, google for example has a bot called a Googlebot, these bots also referred to as
            spider web robots search the web for you in a matter of seconds and list all the sites relevant to your
            search. This isn’t just the extent to which they function though, they can do way more. Bots known as
            trading web bots can compare prices of products that you search collected from a whole array of websites
            allowing you to find the best product. Bots known as media web robots find and return anything from weather
            updates to the latest news relevant to the country you stay in and world news. Web robots are unbelievably
            powerful tools in todays day and age, these are the good legitimate ones. So… all good right? No… they have
            a much darker side to them. Being such a powerful tool, web bots can be used for way more sinister tasks.
            They can be used to perform destructive tasks. They can be used for anything from stealing your private
            information to slowing down your computer. Those annoying pop-ups that we all get, these are called spam
            bots, they collect information about you for example your email address so that companies can spam you with
            advertising. Hacker bots find weaknesses in websites and exploit them to gain access and maliciously use the
            information. Botnets are another one of these great threats to our internet security, ghost networks that
            are used by hackers to perform dangerous attacks on the internet and could take over your computer without
            you knowing. Downloading bots can spam you with messages saying you must download software to continue, bad
            choice if you clicked yes, malware can slow down your computer or even turn it into a brick. We all have a
            darker side to us and robots are no different, they can be used for sinister purposes with malicious intent
            to steal or hard or they can be used to help us and for good reasons and intent. With this great power comes
            great responsibility.
