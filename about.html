            <p>Hi everybody, my name is Dylan and this is my blog page. I am a 25 year old man. An extroverted
                thrill seeker who has a
                passion for the outdoors and people. I will be blogging about my life, Friends and family in the
                city of Johannesburg,
                South Africa.</p>

            <h2 class="shadow">Characters description and rationale</h2>
            &nbsp;
            <p>My character is a thrill and adventure seeker who is always looking to experience something new that
                he hasn't seen before. Being highly extroverted he finds comfort in crowds and being with people
                sharing his experiences. With being highly extroverted he is also quite hot headed and impatient at
                times when he is frustrated or uneasy but he is also one of the most laid back and easy going people
                when he is comfortable in his enviroment. Being based in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa my
                character Dylan loves to travel and explore different people, cultures and places.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p> He also has a keen
                eye
                for art and images when on adventures end exploring leading to him collecting memes and comedic images
                that he finds funny. He has quite a broad sense of humor anything
                from well placed comments, to funny pictures makes him laugh, with this sense of humor being so
                prominant he often jokes around a lot and tires to make light of dim situations. my character is also
                very OCD about preperation before going out on an adventure, checking the weather forecast dayly before
                going out to make sure that he is dressed appropriately, because theres nothing worse than a cold breeze
                when you are wearing shorts out. He is very rational and rarely allows his emotions affect his
                desisions. This prodominant rational thinking is very useful in stressful situations allowing him to
                make the best logical desision that he can make.
