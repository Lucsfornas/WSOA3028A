            <h3>The web 2.0</h3>
            <p>Imagine a world with no social media, no youtube, no apps or online games. For the newer generations this
                seems like an impossible world to live in, the idea of not being connected is a scary thought, but for
                the
                older generations this was once a reality… even the thought of sending a message or image to someone
                halfway
                across the world in seconds was a crazy idea. I know for sure that I would never be able to survive in
                such
                a reality. Before the upgraded version of the web (known as the web 2.0) the internet was very bland,
                only
                reems of text could be searched and what would return would be text as well not nice to look at if
                you’re a
                person who has no clue what’s cooking. Then this all changed with the invention of the web 2.0. the web
                2.0
                was focused on more user generated content and ease of use for the average everyday person, this means
                that
                you don’t need to be an expert to know how to use the web, simply click and go!! This opened up a whole
                world of opportunities and access to archives upon archives of information, you could now search images,
                videos, chat with friends on social media networking sites, the list goes on and on. However this was
                not an
                instant upgrade, the move from the web 1.0 to 2.0 took years to fully establish, slowly getting more
                users.
                Without making the internet widely accessible to the people of the world the advancement in technologies
                and
                the great advancement of knowledge that we’ve seen in the past few years would’ve never taken place.

            <h3>The Browser wars</h3>
            <p>How did the world wide web go from being unbelievably difficult to navigate to the most easily accessible
                source of information that the world has ever known?? This is all thanks to the browser. But how did the
                browser come about you ask?
                Well long ago a team of undergraduate students at the university of Illinois lead by Marc Andreessen had
                an
                idea, to make the world wide web easily accessible to everyone and so a software program called the
                browser
                was born, an interface that turned text only data into images, videos, hypertexts and many more ways of
                viewing data. This made surfing the internet a user-friendly experience for all to enjoy.
                So how did the browser start?
                While in university the team of students developed mosaic, the first user friendly browser, this was
                sadly
                owned by the university as they developed it at the university and they owned the intellectual rights to
                the
                information. So to avoid being taken to court the team had to start from the ground up in redeveloping
                the
                browser software, they made it better that the last and added new features. This was the rise of the
                first
                internet browser and netscape was born, a completely new browser with new features that made use of new
                techniques to secure the users data, these are the SSL Protocol and the TLS to add privacy and security.
                This was the beginning of the browser wars. Microsoft then bought Mosaic the program that the students
                had
                previously developed and developed a new browser, Internet Explorer. This browser competed with
                netscapes
                browser. This is the start of the war between them. Microsoft being the multi-billion dollar company
                that it
                is was basically a ‘super-power’ that Netscape could not compete with. Microsoft then won the war with
                internet explorer, netscape stayed alive for a partial time after that but eventually had to close down.
                But
                netscape had one final trick up their sleeve, before closing down Netscape publicaly released the source
                code for their browser hoping that this would give rise to new browser developers that could challenge
                microsofts internet explorer, and so it did and new browsers started to appear, Mozilla and Firefox
                being
                the most popular these are all build on netscapes original source code.

            <h3>What are URLs and how do they work?</h3>
            <p>A URL… sounds complicated right? I’m writing this to shed some light on the matter. In plain terms the
                URL or
                Uniform Resource Locator is one of the most important cogs that makes a web browser tick. It allows a
                browser to fetch any resources on the web . it is nothing more than a unique address to where
                information
                that you are looking for can be found. Its basically like asking for a friends home address so that you
                know
                where he keeps all his stuff.
                So how do they work ?
                Well I wont bore you with many technical terms but think of your browser as a GPS, you type in the
                address
                that you want to go to and it uses a path to go to directly to that address, fetches what you need and
                then
                brings it back to you, so that the stuff stored at your friends house is now available for you to use.
                But
                URLs have a lot more complexity behind them. They have many different aspects of the address that they
                specifically look at and that are critical to their functioning, they have protocols which tells the
                browser
                how to transport the data forward and back from the server, ports which tells the browser which gate to
                use
                and get into the website, paths to files which detail exactly where the file that you are searching for
                can
                be found. I think that these are the most important aspects of the URL however the URL cannot can not
                function without the Domain names, Parameters, and Anchors. Together all of these modules form the URL
                and
                how it functions. The URL is arguably one of the most important aspects of the internet and without it,
                the
                internet would not function.

            <h3>A reflection on a brief history of web robots</h3>
            <p>They go by many names, web robots, crawlers, spiders. What actually are they? Well they’re programs that
                search the internet for you to find many different types of information that can either be used for good
                intentions, to help us, or for bad intentions.
                Lets face it we’re all lazy, its what makes us human I would even go as far as saying its in our DNA. So
                why
                crawl the internet yourself which could take hours to find what you’re looking for when you can just get
                something else to do it for you, making your life so much easier. This is where web robots come in. they
                search the internet for you and return information that they’ve found regarding what you’ve searched.
                Almost
                all search engines use them, google for example has a bot called a Googlebot, these bots also referred
                to as
                spider web robots search the web for you in a matter of seconds and list all the sites relevant to your
                search. This isn’t just the extent to which they function though, they can do way more. Bots known as
                trading web bots can compare prices of products that you search collected from a whole array of websites
                allowing you to find the best product. Bots known as media web robots find and return anything from
                weather
                updates to the latest news relevant to the country you stay in and world news. Web robots are
                unbelievably
                powerful tools in todays day and age, these are the good legitimate ones. So… all good right? No… they
                have
                a much darker side to them. Being such a powerful tool, web bots can be used for way more sinister
                tasks.
                They can be used to perform destructive tasks. They can be used for anything from stealing your private
                information to slowing down your computer. Those annoying pop-ups that we all get, these are called spam
                bots, they collect information about you for example your email address so that companies can spam you
                with
                advertising. Hacker bots find weaknesses in websites and exploit them to gain access and maliciously use
                the
                information. Botnets are another one of these great threats to our internet security, ghost networks
                that
                are used by hackers to perform dangerous attacks on the internet and could take over your computer
                without
                you knowing. Downloading bots can spam you with messages saying you must download software to continue,
                bad
                choice if you clicked yes, malware can slow down your computer or even turn it into a brick. We all have
                a
                darker side to us and robots are no different, they can be used for sinister purposes with malicious
                intent
                to steal or hard or they can be used to help us and for good reasons and intent. With this great power
                comes
                great responsibility.

            <h3>What is html and how does it work?</h3>
            &nbsp;
            <p>So what is html? Well html is a hyper-text markup language, which for those of you who don’t know is a
                language created to enable the creation of websites that can be viewed by anyone on the internet, it is
                an
                unbelievably powerful tool in today’s modern age world allowing information to be shared to everybody in
                the
                world by just the click of a button. The hyperlink is basically the “car” of the internet allowing you
                to
                select a destination and you are taken to that destination within a matter of milliseconds. Html is a
                collection of code that can be read by an internet browser telling it what to display to the viewer and
                in
                what way to display it. There are many different tools that a web designer must use to make to
                information
                displayed easily readable and distinguishable to the viewer, these are critical in designing a good and
                interactive website. Many of these include headers, italics, bold and many more. The way the website
                looks
                aesthetically is also a critical part of the website and this is controlled through code called CSS
                code, or
                cascading style sheet code. The CSS code part will tell the browser how to display the text, in what
                format,
                what colors to paint the backgrounds and foregrounds and the text and many more things. In conclusion
                the
                creation of html is one of the most important aspects in use in the web today and holds unbelievable
                power
                due to the fact that it is the medium that easily communicates information out to the world.

            <h3>Wireframes and why they are so important</h3>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Wireframes are one of the most important aspects of a website because they allow a designer to plan out
                in
                detail how the information will be communicated to the viewers on the internet. The end user will never
                see
                the wireframe, it is just a tool for the designer to use to get there ducks in a row and it is
                especially
                important to create a wireframe if working in a team so that all the designers and developers know what
                the
                end product should look like. Wireframes are just the skeleton of what the website should look like,
                drawn
                with basic shapes and boxes. Wireframes allow designers to explore different design options and which
                design
                option would be the best to communicate the information that they have. Personally, my own wireframe has
                changed multiple times, the first one being way too overcrowded with information, I then organized it in
                a
                way that the first page is simple with menus allowing the viewer to select the information that they
                wish to
                view. The color of my website has also changed many times going from more vibrant bright colors to more
                sophisticated light greys and blues. To round everything up a wireframe is more of a tool to
                conceptualize
                what the designer wants out of a website and this is always fluid and subject to change to improve on
                the
                look and feel of the website.

            <h3>Online learning, how can we make the jump? </h3>
            &nbsp;
            <p>It is no secret that Covid-19 has now changed the world and flipped it upside down, the lives of the
                people
                on the earth have changed drastically in only a few short weeks but what does that mean for scholars and
                the
                world of education? Thankfully the internet has provided many platforms for the people of the world to
                stay
                sane and communicate knowledge through many different programs, zoom, MS teams etc. but how does one
                stay
                focused? Coming from a student with mild ADHD and the attention span of a goldfish I’ve found this quite
                a
                challenge, so I turned to the one place that could give me the best advice, the internet. Here are a few
                tricks that have helped me, firstly find a nice quite place where you won’t be disturbed as often and a
                nice
                big bottle of concerta. Secondly try to minimize distractions, and that doesn’t mean minimize YouTube,
                it
                means close YouTube and resist the urge to open it back up. And lastly the thing that probably helped me
                the
                most… rewards. If you reward yourself after working you get a feeling of actually accomplishing
                something,
                for me the extra spicy Doritos work like a charm.

                to being the smart city of the future? The answer shouldn't surprise you, Cape Town being one of the
                most
                important cities for our economy is the most technologically advanced city in South Africa. This is no
                doubt
                due to its many factors that make it popular like tourism and the wealth that it brings in. These cities
                are
                the new age cities of the future, where information is collected from the cities people in order to
                optimise
                its resources and connect people, improving trading and business. This status of an advanced city draws
                attention globally for being so cutting edge and improving the lives of people, attracting business.
                But what makes a city a digital capital? well it can be anything that the city posseses that generates
                information to improve and optimise living, this can be anything from smart roads and streetlights to
                smart
                watering systems that water only when needed. The possabilities are endless with technology at
                humanities
                fingertips making one wonder how cities and people will live in the future.

            <h3> The Digital divide and how it affect us</h3>
            &nbsp;
            <p>
                A digital divide the uneven distribution of Technologies and the accsess to Technologies and
                communications.
                These divides happen all over the world because of the extreemly high cost to impliment
                these infrastructures and technologies. This creates a divide between people who have constant access to
                technologies and the infrastructure to use them, whether it be cell towers to transmit data or something
                as
                small as a cellphone. Many more factors affect this digital divide in societies. digital literacy being
                one
                of them, having the knowledge to use and navigate the internet is a skill the world takes for granted,
                being
                able to access information 24/7 at the click of a button is an unbelievably powerful tool. Older
                generations
                that did not grow up with technology and that struggle to use it can not operate technologies as well as
                they younger generations, this leads to the older generations not using technology to its full
                potential,
                this creates a age related digital divide.many more factors like income and location also widen this
                digital
                divide, but how does this affect us? well the more people connected to the internet the more information
                that is transmitted throughout the world, diversifying our knowledge of forign culture and practices
                that
                could aid in society and make life better. The age gap between generations also adds to how this digital
                divide affects us, this means that the older generations must rely of the younger generations to help
                operate the technology. As this digital divide closes the world will see a meshing of cultures and a
                vast
                archive of information from all over
                the globe improving lives all around.

            <h3>Ethnical Implimentation of UX and UI</h3>
            &nbsp;
            <p>
                UX and Ui designs are one of the most powerful tools that a developer has at their disposal, and like
                any
                powerful tool it can both be used in a good way or a bad way. In the age of information a developer
                becomes
                something similar to a scribe and an archetect, recording information for billions of people to see and
                access through their design of a website or app. They way these websites are seen and layed out are all
                thanks to UX and UI. The way that information is being presented to the end user can differ in many ways
                with good UI and UX design making a websites information readily available at the click of a button and
                easily navigatable this makes it ethnical. By designing a website in such a way by using tools like bold
                text to highlight important information and a menu system catagorise the contained information making
                the
                experience easy and fun for the user. This is however, not always the case. UX and UI can also be made
                in a bad
                way making it unethical, this can be done in many ways, from making a big button that people click by
                mistake when scrolling and are taken to another site to advertising information that the website does
                not
                posses just to
                get the user to click on the site. The bad design of UX and UI make the website harder to navigate
                making
                the end user search around for longer trying to find the information they need making it more
                frustrating to
                visit your site.

            <h3>A close reading of Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” (Required Blog post week
                11)
            </h3>
            <p>The aim of the paper is to show how information geographies have their own geographical distrubution,
                geography of access, geography of participation and geography of representation all adapted to local
                context
                and geography. The methods used to show this are broad surveys of different platforms that host,
                administrate and produce various types of geographical infromation by using combination of existing
                statistics and specific data not used or mapped before. The paper’s results show a geography of uneven
                acces
                to the current ways of communication, uneven geography of participation and representation and that
                these
                are obvious and even amplified rather than reduced.

                The paper goes on to say that before the information or digital revolution, information was distributed
                by
                books or news articles with physical storage and the tools for analysing, checking, collecting and
                issuing
                geographical stories and geographical information were in the hands of few qualified people. With the
                advent
                of the internet everyone can publish, news travels widely, fast and on a large scale. Information is
                power
                and those that have access to the production and issuing of information use it to exert economic, social
                and
                political power. This is true of both pre and post digital era but the eneven relatioship between the
                production of information and its distribution has highlighted spatial inequalities eg Africa has
                technological deficit compared to asia, europe or America. Access to internet and broadband
                affordability
                being a major barrier to participation in poorer countries with lower incomes as well as the eneven
                geographies. Besides access, there is a lack of computer coding skills required to participate and work
                collaboratively on shared platfoms such as GitHub or Wikipedia on the african continent as opposed to
                Europe
                or America.

                Barriers to produing and processing information are greatly lowered allowing people access to
                information
                and knowledge regardless of their geography but the question now is how has this altered the political
                economy of information?
                The paper covers a broad survey of who has access to technology (using World Bank statistics of internet
                access to show global trends), where is the digital information generated and in which parts of the
                world is
                the content created and who is represented (using the International Telecommunications Union as a
                source).

                In general this highlights inequalities and disparaties geographically, the global North having the
                highest
                level of participation and generating information and the South, Africa in particular, the lowest. Even
                the
                way places are represented or omitted within information geographies shows wide differences in spatial
                representation. Google indexes show selective representation of countries and highlightls the broader
                uneven
                inequality picture of the Web. OSM, Freebase and Geonames further imbalances in the wider picture of
                information ecosystems. Some parts of the world are massively over-represented and others grossly
                under-represented.

                As the paper concluded, this is a very broad picture of geographical production, representation of
                information & access and participation in it and is really only telling us what we already logically
                know
                about the disparaies looked at. The paper rightly suggests that looking into cultural, information
                governance, political control of geographic information, affordability , access to infrustuture of
                connectivity, censorship etc are factors deserving more focus to understand and improve on the current
                geographies of information. This, I think, will be of more value.

            <h2>Week twelve Blog post</h2>

            <h3>Critical Reflection on Tweet(Required Blog post week 15)</h3>
            &nbsp;
            <img src="../tweetwebsite.png" alt="Example" width="1000" height="500" class="cen">
            &nbsp;
            <p>The predominant issue being discussed in this tweet is the inhumane nature that the current global
                pandemic
                has brought. Neil Ferguson is a British epidemiologist who had a dominant influence in the lockdown
                policies
                in the U.K. He modelled and coded simulations in an attempt to learn more about the Covid-19 Virus. He
                was
                perceived as a hero to the general public, as he was a head figure and symbol of hope during this
                pandemic,
                but this did not last. It was later revealed that the code he has been using in these simulations was
                chaotic and poorly done, yet it was still used without a question. In recent news, it was released that
                Ferguson violated his own lockdown regulations in order to peruse lustful intentions with a marries
                woman.

                This reflects a huge ethical issue that is the degradation of the value of human life. How can the lives
                and
                livelihood of millions of people be equated and reduced to a code that was written over 13 years ago for
                the
                flu? Rigid policies were made based around this simulation that are now most likely inaccurate, and more
                decisions are still being made. Covid-19 is a virus that we know nearly nothing about, and we are basing
                our
                adapted way of living on a flawed representation. One wrong fact could lead to devastating consequences.
                As
                said in the tweet, no one bothered checking the codes being used. The mere fact that it was discovered
                that
                Ferguson, the “Joan of Arc” himself, was suffering from the virus proves that these inhumane
                stipulations
                being directed are unethical, and they simulations are not bringing results. The life of human beings is
                at
                stake, following lockdown regulations dictated from a man who doesn’t care.
