        <h2>Website Style Guide</h2>
        &nbsp;
        <p>In this section i will be discussing how, in light of the UX and UI theories discussed in class the
            wireframe of my website has changed. My wireframe has changed many times with many different iterations,
            the image above is one of the first wireframes made for this website.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>In the theories discussed the Van Restoff Effect is discussed, i have made use of this effect in the menu
            header of my website by making the about and design elements of the menu seporate from the main home
            page and two blog pages. this is because van Restoffs effect states that when similar objects are
            present the one that differs the most is the most memorable, i have used this to make my home page and
            blog pages memorable.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>The centralised text on the nav bar draws attention to the centre of the page, the pages have been
            constructed in such a way that they are very simple and easy to use, all of the information that one
            requires from this site is easily found and accessed.</p>
