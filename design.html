        <h2 class="shadow">Website Style Guide</h2>
        &nbsp;
        <p>In this section i will be discussing how, in light of the UX and UI theories discussed in class the
            wireframe of my website has changed. My wireframe has changed many times with many different iterations,
            the image above is one of the first wireframes made for this website.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>In the theories discussed the Van Restoff Effect is discussed, i have made use of this effect in the menu
            header of my website by making the about and design elements of the menu seporate from the main home
            page and two blog pages. This is because van Restoffs effect states that when similar objects are
            present the one that differs the most is the most memorable, i have used this to make my home page and
            blog pages memorable, by using the color orange in the header and selected other areas i have also
            made the website more memorable because the orange colour differs from the dominant blue colour of the
            site. The text of the main sections and blog posts are in and off white colour to make the text easier to
            read against the darker blue background. On each of the html pages the headings have a drop shadow behind
            them to make them more visible and stand out to the viewer by adding a 3D type effect. By making all
            elements in the website easily
            accessable to the users it makes a pleasant experience for the users.

        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>The design behind the text of the nav bar is to draw the users attention, this allows the user to easily find
            the information that they are looking for from the home page. This nav bar design is deployed on every html
            page for easy navigation and uniformity. The Adademic Blog and character blog sections are also outfitted
            with a secondary
            navigation section that allows the users of the site to easily find the blog posts that they are searching
            for and by using this navigation section they will be taken directly to the posts location on the page.
            By changing the text of the website to Raleway, san sarif it makes the website unique and more interesting
            without compromising the readablility of the text. by changing the line weight and font size to larger
            values
            makes the text more readable and visible to the viewers of the site.

        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            The external dependancy weather API was put on its own seporate html page in order to seporately style the
            page. This adds one more click to the viewers exploration of the page which is not a good thing, but this
            was done in order to fit more information on the page and seporately style it from the others. This page
            makes use of the drop shadow effect to bolfify the information being presented to the viewer. The input text
            was also changed to the orange colour for better visibility.

        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            The wireframe of the website had to be changed many times to make the website more responsive to all
            platforms, including mobile. This means that the websites layout had to change to incoperate the changes. by
            lining up the top nav links it makes the website more comfortable to look at but when viewed in mobile view
            the nav elements compress correctly.
