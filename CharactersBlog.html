        <p>Hi my name is Dylan. I'm an adrenaline junkie, skydiving, bungie jumping, you name it i've done it! i thought

            my many endevours. hope you enjoy!! </p>

        <p>Wow I actually never thought that I would be doing this, writing isn’t really my strong point but my urge to
            get my stories out actually excites me a little bit. So here it goes…
            Hi guys I’m Dylan I think I’m an alcoholic…
            I’m only joking but let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a very social creature, I love being
            around people, chatting to them, dancing, meeting new people and forming friendships is what I excel at. So
            as you can imagine the Covid-19 lockdown and isolation has changed my life quite a bit. Originally this blog
            was going to be about wild stories of what happens on a night out (there still will be wild stories) but I
            have chosen to direct the main focus of this blog on how I have adapted to this situation.
